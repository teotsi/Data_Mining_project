Bike Rental Predictor (With Regressors ?????)

1) One-Hot encoding: Convert a non-binary column to multiple binary columns(this may require
dropping other redundant columns)

2) Cross Validation: The process of deciding whether the numerical results quantifying hypothesised relationships 
between variables, are acceptable as descriptions of the data, is known as validation.

3) GridSearchCV: Search for the best possible hyper-parameters for the model and then
use cross-validation to determine the accuracy of your model's predictions 

4) Regularization: Limit the results to [0,1]

5) Search for outliers' impact: Outliers are parameter values which are either very high or
very low for the particular parameter. We need to determine the impact these values have
on the model's prediction.

6) Use ensemble models: Use multiple models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest Regression, etc)
